This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  After selecting a file, the promise returned by `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` sometimes rejects with an error, even when file selection was successful. The error message is not always consistent, but it often involves issues related to file URI resolution or permissions. This can happen even when the necessary permissions have been explicitly granted in the app's manifest and at runtime.
